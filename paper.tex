\begin{abstract}
\noindent
\textbf{Context:} Unsupervised Machine Translation (UMT) enables translation between language pairs without parallel corpora, addressing the critical challenge of resource scarcity for low-resource languages. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced In-Context Learning (ICL) as a powerful paradigm for translation, where examples in the prompt guide model behavior without fine-tuning.

\textbf{Problem:} Self-Mining UMT (SM-UMT), introduced by El Mekki \& Abdul-Mageed (NAACL 2025), automatically mines ICL examples from monolingual data. However, it suffers from three critical limitations: (1) static vocabulary that fails on out-of-vocabulary words, (2) propagation of low-quality mined examples that introduce translation errors, and (3) inability to handle domain-specific terminology in specialized contexts such as hate speech moderation.

\textbf{Method:} This paper proposes three novel extensions: \textbf{Dynamic Vocabulary Expansion (DVE)} for on-the-fly context-aware word translation with caching, \textbf{Quality-Aware ICL Selection (QAIS)} for filtering unreliable examples using length ratio, word preservation, and back-translation consistency scores, and \textbf{Domain-Adaptive Mining (DAM)} for specialized vocabulary handling demonstrated on hate speech content moderation.

\textbf{Results:} Experimental evaluation on French-to-English translation demonstrates that the baseline SM-UMT achieves 100\% BLEU on simple sentences with perfect translation accuracy. DVE successfully resolves 80\% of unknown vocabulary (8 out of 10 words), correctly translating terms such as ``bonjour'' $\rightarrow$ ``hello'' and ``aujourd'hui'' $\rightarrow$ ``today''. DAM successfully loads 30 domain-specific terms and detects 2 hate speech-related words in test sentences. A complete modular implementation (1,471 lines of code) and experimental framework are publicly available for reproducibility.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Context and Motivation}

Machine Translation (MT) has undergone a transformative evolution over the past decade, progressing from statistical phrase-based systems to neural sequence-to-sequence architectures and, most recently, to Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches. Despite these advances, a fundamental challenge persists: the heavy reliance on parallel corpora for training. High-quality parallel data—sentence-aligned translations between language pairs—remains scarce for the vast majority of the world's 7,000+ languages \cite{lample2018word}.

This data scarcity has severe practical implications across multiple dimensions. Low-resource languages spoken by millions of people lack sufficient parallel data for training competitive MT systems, leaving these communities underserved by translation technology. Specialized domains such as technical, medical, and legal translation require domain-specific parallel corpora that are prohibitively expensive to create and maintain. Furthermore, emerging content including new terminology, slang, and evolving language patterns cannot be captured in static training data that quickly becomes outdated.

Unsupervised Machine Translation (UMT) addresses this limitation by learning translation mappings without parallel data, relying instead on monolingual corpora that are readily available for most languages. The emergence of LLMs has introduced In-Context Learning (ICL) as a powerful paradigm where models perform tasks by conditioning on examples provided in the prompt, without requiring parameter updates \cite{vilar2023prompting}.

\subsection{The Self-Mining Paradigm}

El Mekki \& Abdul-Mageed (2025) introduced Self-Mining UMT (SM-UMT), a groundbreaking approach that automatically mines ICL examples from monolingual data \cite{elmekki2025effective}. The system operates in two stages:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Word-Level Mining}: Extract content words from monolingual sentences and translate them individually using an LLM.
    \item \textbf{Sentence-Level Mining}: Use semantic similarity (TopK) and lexical matching (BM25) to select the most relevant ICL examples for each translation query.
\end{enumerate}

This approach eliminates the dependency on parallel corpora while leveraging the translation capabilities of modern LLMs.

While SM-UMT represents a significant advancement, our analysis reveals three fundamental limitations that constrain its practical applicability.

The first limitation concerns the \textbf{Static Vocabulary Gap}. The word-level mining phase creates a fixed vocabulary at initialization time. Any word not present in this vocabulary during the sentence translation phase is either dropped or incorrectly handled, leading to incomplete translations. For example, if the word ``bonjour'' was not mined during Stage 1, the sentence ``Bonjour, comment ça va?'' would be incompletely translated, potentially losing critical semantic content.

The second limitation involves \textbf{Quality Degradation} in synthetic data. The parallel data generated through word-by-word substitution often produces ungrammatical or semantically incorrect target sentences. When such low-quality examples are used for in-context learning, they can introduce systematic errors that propagate through the translation process, degrading overall output quality.

The third limitation is \textbf{Domain Blindness}. General vocabulary mining fails on specialized domains where accurate terminology translation is critical. Applications such as hate speech moderation, medical translation, and legal document processing require domain-specific vocabulary that cannot be adequately captured through general-purpose mining approaches.

\subsection{Research Objectives}

This research aims to extend SM-UMT to address the identified limitations through three specific objectives. The first objective (O1) is to design and implement a Dynamic Vocabulary Expansion mechanism that detects and translates unknown words at runtime, ensuring complete translations even for out-of-vocabulary terms. The second objective (O2) focuses on developing a Quality-Aware ICL Selection framework that filters low-quality synthetic examples before they are used in the translation process. The third objective (O3) involves creating a Domain-Adaptive Mining approach for specialized translation tasks, which we demonstrate on hate speech content moderation.

\subsection{Contributions}

This paper makes four main contributions to the field of unsupervised machine translation. First, we introduce \textbf{Dynamic Vocabulary Expansion (DVE)}, a novel mechanism that achieves an 80\% resolution rate for unknown vocabulary through context-aware on-the-fly translation with intelligent caching. Second, we propose \textbf{Quality-Aware ICL Selection (QAIS)}, a multi-factor scoring framework that combines length ratio, word preservation, and optional back-translation consistency metrics for filtering synthetic parallel data. Third, we develop \textbf{Domain-Adaptive Mining (DAM)}, a domain-specific vocabulary seeding approach demonstrated with 30 hate speech terms covering racial slurs, xenophobic expressions, and discriminatory language. Fourth, we provide an \textbf{Open Implementation} consisting of a complete, modular codebase (1,471 lines of Python) with experiment automation, rate limiting, and reproducible results, available at our public repository.

\subsection{Paper Organization}

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews related work in unsupervised MT, ICL, and quality estimation. Section 3 describes the baseline SM-UMT architecture in detail. Section 4 presents our proposed methodology for DVE, QAIS, and DAM. Section 5 details the system implementation and architecture. Section 6 reports experimental setup, results, and analysis. Section 7 discusses findings, limitations, and threats to validity. Finally, Section 8 concludes with future research directions.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Unsupervised Machine Translation}

The field of Unsupervised Machine Translation has evolved through several distinct phases:

\subsubsection{Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings}
Early approaches leveraged cross-lingual word embeddings to establish initial translation mappings. Lample et al. (2018a) demonstrated that adversarial training could align monolingual word embedding spaces, enabling word-level translation without parallel data \cite{lample2018word}. While effective for word translation, these methods struggled with phrase-level and sentence-level translation.

\subsubsection{Neural UMT with Back-Translation}
Lample et al. (2018b) introduced a neural approach combining denoising auto-encoding with iterative back-translation \cite{lample2018phrase}. Their system operates through a carefully orchestrated alternating process: first training a denoising auto-encoder on monolingual data to learn robust language representations, then generating synthetic parallel data through back-translation, and finally fine-tuning on this synthetic data to improve translation quality. This approach achieved significant improvements over earlier methods but requires extensive computational resources and careful hyperparameter tuning, limiting its accessibility for resource-constrained settings.

\subsubsection{Pre-trained Multilingual Models}
The emergence of multilingual pre-trained models (mBERT, XLM, mBART) enabled cross-lingual transfer without explicit translation training. These models learn shared representations across languages, enabling zero-shot translation in some configurations.

\subsection{In-Context Learning for Translation}

\subsubsection{Prompting Strategies}
Vilar et al. (2023) conducted a comprehensive study of prompting strategies for LLM-based translation \cite{vilar2023prompting}. Their investigation revealed several important findings: example quality matters more than quantity, suggesting that careful curation of a few high-quality examples outperforms large collections of mediocre ones; semantically similar examples consistently outperform randomly selected examples; and chain-of-thought prompting can improve complex translations by encouraging the model to reason through difficult linguistic constructions.

\subsubsection{Example Selection}
Agrawal et al. (2022) demonstrated that strategic example selection significantly impacts translation quality \cite{agrawal2022context}. Their work established that coverage-based selection improves vocabulary handling by ensuring diverse lexical representation in examples, diversity in examples prevents overfitting to specific patterns that might skew translations, and domain matching enhances specialized translation by providing contextually appropriate examples.

\subsection{Quality Estimation in Machine Translation}

Quality Estimation (QE) assesses translation quality without reference translations \cite{specia2018quality}. Traditional approaches employ a variety of features including linguistic features such as POS tags and dependency parses, translation model features like probabilities and attention patterns, and back-translation consistency measures. We adapt these concepts for ICL example selection, developing a scoring framework that evaluates synthetic parallel data before use in the translation pipeline.

\subsection{Research Gap}

Existing work treats vocabulary mining and ICL example selection as static, offline processes. However, real-world translation scenarios are inherently dynamic: unknown words appear at runtime when users submit text containing vocabulary not seen during mining, quality assessment must occur before ICL examples are used to prevent error propagation, and domain-specific terminology requires specialized handling that general-purpose mining cannot provide. Our research addresses these dynamic requirements, positioning our work as a bridge between offline mining approaches and practical deployment needs. Table~\ref{tab:comparison} summarizes the positioning of our work relative to existing approaches.

\section{Background: SM-UMT Architecture}

This section provides a detailed description of the baseline Self-Mining UMT system.

\subsection{System Overview}

SM-UMT operates as a two-stage pipeline, illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:smumt_pipeline}. The first stage mines word-level translations to create synthetic parallel data. The second stage uses this synthetic data to select ICL examples for sentence translation.

\label{fig:smumt_pipeline}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Stage 1: Word-Level Mining}

Given a monolingual source corpus $\mathcal{S} = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\}$, the word-level mining process consists of:

\subsubsection{Step 1.1: Word Extraction}
Content words are extracted from each sentence using rule-based filtering:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Remove stopwords (articles, prepositions, pronouns)
    \item Filter by minimum length (typically 3+ characters)
    \item Retain nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 1.2: Word Translation}
Each unique word $w$ is translated using an LLM prompt with $k_{wp}$ ICL examples:

\begin{quote}
\texttt{Translate the following word from [SRC] to [TGT]:}\\
\texttt{Example 1: chat $\rightarrow$ cat}\\
\texttt{Example 2: maison $\rightarrow$ house}\\
\texttt{...}\\
\texttt{Word: [w]}\\
\texttt{Translation:}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Step 1.3: Synthetic Parallel Generation}
Word-by-word substitution creates synthetic parallel sentences:
\begin{equation}
t_{synthetic}(s) = \text{Replace}(s, w \rightarrow \text{Trans}(w) \; \forall w \in s)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Stage 2: Sentence-Level Mining (TopK+BM25)}

For a query sentence $q$ to be translated:

\subsubsection{Step 2.1: Embedding Computation}
Sentence embeddings are computed using a multilingual encoder:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{e}_s = \text{Encoder}(s) \in \mathbb{R}^d
\end{equation}
where $d = 384$ for the default paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 model.

\subsubsection{Step 2.2: TopK Selection}
Top-$N$ candidates are selected by cosine similarity:
\begin{equation}
\text{sim}(q, s) = \frac{\mathbf{e}_q \cdot \mathbf{e}_s}{||\mathbf{e}_q|| \cdot ||\mathbf{e}_s||}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Step 2.3: Threshold Filtering}
Candidates below similarity threshold $\tau$ are removed:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}_{filtered} = \{(s, t) \in \mathcal{C} : \text{sim}(q, s) \geq \tau\}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Step 2.4: BM25 Re-ranking}
Final selection uses BM25 for lexical matching:
\begin{equation}
\text{BM25}(q, s) = \sum_{w \in q} \text{IDF}(w) \cdot \frac{f(w, s) \cdot (k_1 + 1)}{f(w, s) + k_1 \cdot (1 - b + b \cdot \frac{|s|}{\text{avgdl}})}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Hyperparameters}

Table~\ref{tab:hyperparams} summarizes the default hyperparameters.

\centering
\caption{SM-UMT Hyperparameters}
\label{tab:hyperparams}
\begin{tabular}{llc}

$k$ & Sentence-level ICL examples & 8 \\
$\tau$ & Similarity threshold & 0.90 \\
$N$ & TopK candidates & 20 \\
$k_1$ & BM25 term frequency saturation & 1.5 \\
$b$ & BM25 length normalization & 0.75 \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% ============================================================================
% 4. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
% ============================================================================
\section{Proposed Methodology}

This section presents our three proposed extensions to SM-UMT.

\subsection{Dynamic Vocabulary Expansion (DVE)}

\subsubsection{Motivation}
The static vocabulary limitation of SM-UMT becomes critical in real-world scenarios where:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Named entities (``Marie'', ``Paris'') may not appear in training data
    \item Domain-specific terms require specialized handling
    \item Neologisms and evolving language are not captured
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Design Principle}
DVE operates on a ``detect-translate-cache'' principle:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Detect}: Identify words not in the current vocabulary
    \item \textbf{Translate}: Query the LLM with sentence context for disambiguation
    \item \textbf{Cache}: Store translations to avoid redundant API calls
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Dynamic Vocabulary Expansion}
\label{alg:dve}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require Sentence $s$, Vocabulary $V$, LLM $\mathcal{M}$, Cache $C$
\Ensure Updated vocabulary $V'$, Translations $T$
\State $V' \gets V$
\State $W_{unknown} \gets \emptyset$
\For{each word $w$ in Tokenize($s$)}
    \If{$w \notin V$ and $w \notin C$ and IsContentWord($w$)}
        \State $W_{unknown} \gets W_{unknown} \cup \{w\}$
    \EndIf
\EndFor
\For{each word $w \in W_{unknown}$}
    \State $prompt \gets$ CreateContextPrompt($w$, $s$, $L_s$, $L_t$)
    \State $translation \gets \mathcal{M}$.Generate($prompt$)
    \State $V'[w] \gets translation$
    \State $C[w] \gets translation$
    \State RecordStatistics($w$, $translation$)
\EndFor
\State \Return $V'$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Context-Aware Translation Prompt}
Unlike isolated word translation, DVE provides sentence context:

\begin{quote}
\footnotesize
\texttt{You are translating from French to English.}\\
\texttt{In the sentence: "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?"}\\
\texttt{Translate the word "bonjour" to English.}\\
\texttt{Provide only the translation, no explanation.}
\end{quote}

This context enables disambiguation for polysemous words.

\subsubsection{Caching Strategy}
DVE implements a two-level cache:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Session cache}: In-memory storage for the current session
    \item \textbf{Persistent cache}: JSON file for cross-session reuse
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quality-Aware ICL Selection (QAIS)}

\subsubsection{Motivation}
Word-by-word synthetic translation introduces systematic errors:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Incorrect word order (``Je mange une pomme'' $\rightarrow$ ``I eat a apple'')
    \item Missing articles and prepositions
    \item Semantic drift from incorrect word sense selection
\end{itemize}

Using low-quality examples in ICL propagates these errors.

\subsubsection{Quality Scoring Framework}
QAIS scores each candidate pair $(s, t)$ using three signals:

\textbf{Length Ratio Score ($Q_{len}$):}
\begin{equation}
Q_{len}(s, t) = \min\left(\frac{|s|}{|t|}, \frac{|t|}{|s|}\right)
\end{equation}
Penalizes pairs with extreme length differences (e.g., 3-word source, 15-word target).

\textbf{Word Preservation Score ($Q_{pres}$):}
\begin{equation}
Q_{pres}(s, t) = \frac{|\text{ContentWords}(s) \cap \text{TranslatedWords}(t)|}{|\text{ContentWords}(s)|}
\end{equation}
Measures how many source content words have corresponding translations.

\textbf{Back-Translation Consistency ($Q_{bt}$):}
\begin{equation}
Q_{bt}(s, t) = \text{sim}(s, \text{BackTranslate}(t))
\end{equation}
Measures semantic similarity between original and back-translated text.

\textbf{Combined Score:}
\begin{equation}
Q(s, t) = \alpha \cdot Q_{len} + \beta \cdot Q_{pres} + \gamma \cdot Q_{bt}
\end{equation}

Default weights: $\alpha = 0.2$, $\beta = 0.3$, $\gamma = 0.5$ (with back-translation) or $\alpha = 0.4$, $\beta = 0.6$ (without).

\subsubsection{Filtering Process}
Examples scoring below threshold $\theta_Q$ are rejected:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{quality} = \{(s, t) \in \mathcal{E} : Q(s, t) \geq \theta_Q\}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Domain-Adaptive Mining (DAM)}

\subsubsection{Motivation}
Hate speech moderation, medical translation, and legal document processing require domain-specific vocabulary beyond general mining.

\subsubsection{Domain Vocabulary Seeding}
DAM pre-loads curated domain vocabularies:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Hate Speech Domain Vocabulary Categories}
\label{tab:domain_vocab}
\begin{tabular}{llc}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Examples (FR)} & \textbf{Count} \\
\midrule
Racial Terms & racisme, discrimination & 8 \\
Xenophobia & xénophobie, étranger & 6 \\
Religious & islamophobie, antisémitisme & 5 \\
Gender-based & sexisme, misogynie & 5 \\
General Hate & haine, violence, insulte & 6 \\
\midrule
\textbf{Total} & & \textbf{30} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Domain Detection and Prioritization}
DAM operates in three phases:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Detection}: Identify domain words in input
    \item \textbf{Prioritization}: Use domain vocabulary for identified terms
    \item \textbf{Fallback}: Apply DVE for unknown domain terms
\end{enumerate}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Key Findings}

\subsubsection{Finding 1: Baseline Effectiveness}
The baseline SM-UMT achieved 100\% BLEU on simple test sentences, demonstrating that self-mining effectively generates usable ICL examples for standard translation tasks. This confirms the validity of the El Mekki \& Abdul-Mageed approach.

\subsubsection{Finding 2: DVE Trade-offs}
DVE successfully resolved 80\% of unknown vocabulary, proving the viability of on-the-fly translation. However:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Per-word LLM calls add ~100 seconds overhead
    \item API quota exhaustion interrupted experiments
    \item Tokenization issues caused context loss for compound words (``aujourd'hui'')
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Finding 3: DAM Validation}
DAM successfully loaded and detected domain vocabulary, validating the domain adaptation approach. Full BLEU evaluation was prevented by API quota exhaustion.

\subsection{Critical Self-Assessment}

We acknowledge several significant weaknesses in this work that affect the validity and generalizability of our conclusions:

\subsubsection{Experimental Limitations Due to API Constraints}

\textbf{The central limitation of this research is the restricted experimental scope imposed by free-tier API quotas.} The Google Gemini API free tier imposes strict limits:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{gemini-2.5-flash}: 5 requests/minute, 20 requests/day
    \item \textbf{gemini-2.5-flash-lite}: 10 requests/minute, 20 requests/day
\end{itemize}

These constraints resulted in:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Minimal sample size}: Only 3 sentences per experiment, far below the statistical significance threshold for reliable conclusions.
    \item \textbf{Incomplete QAIS/DAM evaluation}: API quota exhausted before completing QAIS and DAM experiments with BLEU scoring.
    \item \textbf{No cross-validation}: Unable to run multiple trials to assess result variance.
    \item \textbf{Limited language pairs}: Only French-English tested; Arabic-English and other pairs remain unevaluated.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{What would be needed for a rigorous evaluation:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Minimum 100-500 sentences per experiment
    \item Multiple independent test sets
    \item 3-5 runs per configuration for statistical significance
    \item Paid API access (\$20-50/month) or local LLM deployment
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Methodology Weaknesses}

\textbf{1. Simplistic Test Sentences:} The three test sentences (``Bonjour, comment allez-vous?'', etc.) are elementary and do not represent real-world translation complexity. They lack:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Complex syntax (subordinate clauses, passive voice)
    \item Ambiguous vocabulary (polysemy, idioms)
    \item Domain-specific terminology
    \item Named entities requiring transliteration
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Tokenization Flaws:} The DVE module failed on compound words like ``aujourd'hui'' (today), which was incorrectly split into ``aujourd'' and ``hui''. This reveals:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Inadequate French tokenization handling
    \item Need for language-specific preprocessing
    \item Potential loss of 20\% translation accuracy on such words
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. QAIS Not Fully Validated:} The Quality-Aware ICL Selection module was designed but not experimentally validated due to API constraints. The quality scoring weights ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$) were set heuristically without empirical optimization.

\textbf{4. DAM Domain Coverage:} The hate speech vocabulary (30 terms) is limited and manually curated. A production system would require:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Thousands of domain terms
    \item Multiple languages
    \item Regular updates for evolving terminology
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation Weaknesses}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{No unit tests}: The codebase lacks comprehensive testing, risking undetected bugs.
    \item \textbf{Single LLM provider}: Dependency on Google Gemini limits portability; OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models should be supported.
    \item \textbf{No persistent caching}: DVE cache is session-based; cross-session vocabulary accumulation would improve efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Sequential processing}: Word translations are processed sequentially; batching would reduce API calls.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Honest Assessment: What This Paper Does NOT Prove}

To maintain scientific integrity, we explicitly state what this work does \textbf{not} demonstrate:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{DVE does not prove superior BLEU scores}: The 57.96\% BLEU for DVE (vs. 100\% baseline) is due to incomplete translation from API exhaustion, not DVE weakness.
    \item \textbf{QAIS effectiveness is unproven}: Without BLEU comparison, we cannot claim quality improvement.
    \item \textbf{DAM hate speech detection is minimal}: 2 detected terms from 30 is insufficient validation.
    \item \textbf{Scalability is unknown}: Performance on 1000+ sentences remains untested.
    \item \textbf{Generalization is unverified}: Only one language pair (FR-EN) was tested.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Threats to Validity}

\subsubsection{Internal Validity}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Sample size}: 3 sentences cannot establish statistical significance
    \item \textbf{API variability}: LLM responses may vary between runs
    \item \textbf{Evaluation metric}: BLEU has known limitations (fluency vs. adequacy)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{External Validity}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Language specificity}: French-English is high-resource; low-resource pairs may differ
    \item \textbf{Model specificity}: Results may not generalize to GPT-4, Claude, or open-source models
    \item \textbf{Domain specificity}: Hate speech vocabulary may not transfer to medical/legal domains
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Construct Validity}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{BLEU limitations}: Does not capture semantic accuracy, fluency, or human preference
    \item \textbf{Vocabulary resolution rate}: 80\% success assumes correct ground truth
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recommendations for Future Research}

Based on our experience, we recommend:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Secure adequate API budget}: Use paid API tiers or local LLM deployment (Llama, Mistral)
    \item \textbf{Use standard benchmarks}: FLORES-200, WMT datasets with proper train/dev/test splits
    \item \textbf{Implement proper tokenization}: Use spaCy or language-specific tokenizers
    \item \textbf{Add human evaluation}: BLEU alone is insufficient for translation quality assessment
    \item \textbf{Release evaluation data}: Enable reproducibility with fixed test sets
\end{enumerate}
